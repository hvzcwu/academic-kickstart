 abstract = {Excess moisture in GIS will condense on solid insulating materials under
certain environmental conditions and cause the reduction of flashover
voltage, thus threatening its normal operation. To formulate proper
standard of moisture content in GIS, it's necessary to study the
influence of moisture on the dielectric strength of insulators. In this
paper, the influence of moisture on the flashover voltage of insulators
in SF6 is studied with consideration of ambient temperature. The results
show that flashover voltage of insulators is almost unaffected by
moisture at constant ambient temperature. After a sharp change of
ambient temperature, moisture within a certain amount doesn't influence
flashover voltage of insulators; when the moisture content becomes
larger, flashover voltage begins to decrease. The larger the moisture
content is, the lower flashover voltage becomes. And moisture has a
bigger influence after a sharp rise of ambient temperature than after a
sharp decrease. The range of temperature plays an important role in the
threat caused by moisture. In addition, the experimental results show
that current standard of moisture content cannot guarantee the normal
operation of GIS and some advice is given for modification of the
standard.},
