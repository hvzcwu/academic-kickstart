 abstract = {Gas insulated switchgear (GIS) is widely applied in power systems due to
its excellent insulation performance. The reliability of GIS will be
influenced by various insulation defects generated during the
manufacture, installation, adjustment, operation and maintenance of the
apparatus. Some defects, including conductor spikes, free metal
particles, etc., make local electric field higher. Due to the HUMP
effect of SF6 gas, the partial discharge inception voltage and the
breakdown voltage of these defects are approximate to each other in
non-uniform electric field under operating conditions. These defects
cannot be effectively detected through partial discharge detection
method as a result of this phenomenon. Different geometry of conductor
spikes are used in this article, the partial discharge inception voltage
and the breakdown voltage of these defects are measured by using ERA
method, the results indicate that the breakdown performance is singular
because of existence of space charge, and the partial discharge
performance is closely related to the uniformity of gas gap.},
