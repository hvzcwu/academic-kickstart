 abstract = {Contamination of free conducting particles is a major threat to gas
insulated systems. In HVDC GIL, free conducting particles can be even
more harmful due to the fact that particles can easily cross the gas gap
under DC voltage and distort the electric field. In HVDC systems,
impulse overvoltage can be generated and superimposed on the DC
operating voltage. As a result, GIL will experience superimposed DC and
impulse voltage. In this paper, the behavior of free conducting
particles in HVDC GIL is observed and breakdown characteristics of
particle contaminated GIL under superimposed DC and impulse voltages are
studied. Two motion patterns of free conducting particles in HVDC GIL
are mainly found: bouncing and firefly motions. Particles tend to
firefly motion near the enclosure under positive DC voltage and near the
high voltage bus bar under negative DC voltage. With increased DC
voltage amplitude, the probability of firefly motion increases while the
probability of bouncing motion decreases. It is found that the
insulation strength of GIL is greatly reduced by free conducting
particles under superimposed DC and impulse voltages. With increasing
particle length, the breakdown voltage of GIL under superimposed voltage
decreases sharply. Breakdown voltage decreases slightly with the
increase of particle radius. Breakdown voltage of GIL is lower under
superimposed voltage of negative DC and positive impulse than under
negative DC and negative impulse with the same size of particle. The
results indicate that superimposition of DC operating voltage and
impulse overvoltage can be a critical condition for HVDC GIL if free
conducting particles exist. Therefore, a superimposed DC and impulse
voltage on-site test can be considered for HVDC GIL to check for
insulation performance.},
