abstract: "The basin-type insulator is one of the most important parts in SF6 gas insulated switchgear (GIS). Flashover of basin-type insulators will cause serious harm to the electrical system. The fact that metallic particle attached to the surface cannot be detected in the delivery test under the standard lightning impulse (SLI) will pose potential threat to GIS. This paper studied flashover characteristics of the basin-type insulator with metallic particle contamination attached to its high voltage electrode in SF6 under SLI. An 1800 kV lightning impulse generator and a specialized pulse-voltage divider were used in the study. The results show that the flashover voltage drops rapidly when the metallic particle is attached to its surface. At high pressure, the basin-type insulator will be more sensible to the metallic particle. The metallic particle may cause danger to the system even its size is small. The reduction of flashover voltage will become slow with the increase of the metallic particle's length. The gas pressure has little effect on the flashover voltage rate when the metallic particle exceeds a certain length. The flashover voltage under negative polarity of SLI is higher than that under positive polarity. Polarity effect will be obvious when the gas pressure is low. The discharge development process of basin-type insulator has been studied on the aspect of space charge accumulation at last."
