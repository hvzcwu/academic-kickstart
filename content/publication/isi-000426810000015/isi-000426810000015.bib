 abstract = {The basin-type insulator is one of the most important parts in SF6 gas
insulated switchgear (GIS). Flashover of basin-type insulators will
cause serious harm to the electrical system. The fact that metallic
particle attached to the surface cannot be detected in the delivery test
under the standard lightning impulse (SLI) will pose potential threat to
GIS. This paper studied flashover characteristics of the basin-type
insulator with metallic particle contamination attached to its high
voltage electrode in SF6 under SLI. An 1800 kV lightning impulse
generator and a specialized pulse-voltage divider were used in the
study. The results show that the flashover voltage drops rapidly when
the metallic particle is attached to its surface. At high pressure, the
basin-type insulator will be more sensible to the metallic particle. The
metallic particle may cause danger to the system even its size is small.
The reduction of flashover voltage will become slow with the increase of
the metallic particle's length. The gas pressure has little effect on
the flashover voltage rate when the metallic particle exceeds a certain
length. The flashover voltage under negative polarity of SLI is higher
than that under positive polarity. Polarity effect will be obvious when
the gas pressure is low. The discharge development process of basin-type
insulator has been studied on the aspect of space charge accumulation at
last.},
