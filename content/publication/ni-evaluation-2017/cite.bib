 abstract = {To study the statistical meaning of the time parameter t(63%) in the Martin empirical formula, we took Kunlun 25# transformer oil as the liquid insulating dielectric and utilized an impulse voltage generator, the impulse width of which could range from 50 ns to 1000 its, along with the corresponding measuring equipment. The relationships between the breakdown voltage, the breakdown time lag and the discharge probabilities were acquired through experiments under impulses with quasi-uniform field. The results show that the discharge probabilities of different voltage levels under the fixed impulse waveform and the breakdown time lag under the same voltage level both could be well fitted to the three parameter Weibull distribution functions, whose shape parameter was a constant only correlated to the electrode geometry. Meanwhile, on the basis of the Weibull distribution functions and corresponding impulse waveforms, we defined the effective duration and show the statistical meaning of the time parameter t(63%).},
