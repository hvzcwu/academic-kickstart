 abstract = {In recent years, SF6/N-2 binary mixtures have been used as insulation in
second generation gas-insulated metal-enclosed transmission lines mainly
because of the greenhouse effect and diseconomy of SF6. Though the
synergistic effect of SF6 is known in a uniform electric field, there is
little understanding of the synergistic effect phenomenon with
parameters in a non-uniform electric field under standard lightning
impulse. A series of experiments were designed to increase our knowledge
of this and the breakdown characteristics of SF6/N-2 under multiple
parameters show a negative synergistic effect. Our experimental results
with negative lightning impulse demonstrated that the breakdown voltage
of N-2 increased greater than with both SF6 and its mixtures with
increasing gas pressure. When the gas pressure exceeded 0.3MPa, the
breakdown voltage of pure N-2 was higher than SF6/N-2 gas mixtures and
even exceeded the value of SF6 at 0.5MPa. A normalization coefficient h
was introduced in this research to evaluate the negative synergistic
effect. Under negative lightning impulse the analytical results show
that the negative synergistic effect increased with the augment of gas
pressure. On the other hand, the synergistic effect was reduced with
decreasing gas pressure under positive polarity impulse and it appeared
to be a negative synergistic effect with the enhancement of field
non-uniformity. The analysis of streamer discharge propagation indicates
three reasons lead to the negative synergistic effect: similar streamer
corona onset voltage, different space charge effect, and dissimilar
discharge form of N-2 and SF6/N-2 gas mixtures.},
