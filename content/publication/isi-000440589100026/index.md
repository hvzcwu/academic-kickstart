abstract: "This study aimed to clarify the basic process of streamer propagation in mineral oil at bipolar oscillating impulse voltage. Shadow images and light signals of streamers showed that under bipolar oscillating impulse, positive and negative streamers propagated in an alternating manner: after polarity reversal, new streamers with opposite polarity were initiated and propagated first through the gaseous channels left behind by former streamers and then toward the ground electrode. The velocity of positive streamers was found nearly an order of magnitude higher than that of negative ones; thus, positive streamers are primarily responsible for the insulation failure of mineral oil. Negative streamers played the role of maintaining gaseous channels and facilitating positive streamers initiation due to their strong heat effect. High oscillation frequency and large damping factor decreased the durations and amplitudes of positive peaks, which restrained positive streamer propagation and further resulted in the increase in the breakdown voltage. Experiments on dielectric behavior of mineral oil were conducted to verify above inferences. Published by AIP Publishing."
