abstract: "Even for gas-insulated metal-enclosed switchgear (GIS) equipment that has passed an on-site dielectric test, some dielectric failure can occasionally occur without warning. It is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of on-site dielectric tests of GIS equipment. In this study, two standard test procedures, power-frequency partial discharge (PD) and lighting impulse (LI) withstand test, were carried out in a real model test platform of 550 kV GIS to evaluate the effectiveness of on-site dielectric tests. Through experiments, the minimum detectable defect sizes were determined for different curvature radius values. The results show the limitation of the power-frequency PD test and the need to use of the LI withstand test as supplementary assessment on site. Two calculable constraints of defect detectability were proposed to extend the results to GIS equipment at other voltage levels. The results clarify the cause of dielectric failure without any warning and provide technological guidance for manufacturing and installation."
