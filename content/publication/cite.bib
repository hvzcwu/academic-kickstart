	abstract = {Corona discharge under super low frequency (30-300 Hz) voltage is common in high-voltage transmission lines and equipment. The phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) pattern is the most commonly used tool for power equipment condition-monitoring in the electrical engineering field. The present study centers on the correspondence between PRPD patterns and corona discharge modes under a wide range of applied voltage. Electric and optical emission characteristic measurement methods are applied to obtain PRPD patterns and phase resolved discharge images. The transition of corona discharge types and space charge behavior under different applied voltage are investigated. The electric field generated by negative needle electrode is shown to erase residual positive ions, which leads to an abundance of positive streamer bursts when applied voltage is low. Once the negative glow corona emerges under higher applied voltage, dense positive ions in the cathode sheath suppress the positive streamer bursts. The existence of residual positive ions is crucial for the transition from positive streamer discharge to glow corona discharge. A comprehensive understanding of PRPD patterns may help electrical engineers to assess the threat of partial discharge of the power equipment correctly.},

	abstract = {Even for gas-insulated metal-enclosed switchgear (GIS) equipment that has passed an on-site dielectric test, some dielectric failure can occasionally occur without warning. It is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of on-site dielectric tests of GIS equipment. In this study, two standard test procedures, power-frequency partial discharge (PD) and lighting impulse (LI) withstand test, were carried out in a real model test platform of 550 kV GIS to evaluate the effectiveness of on-site dielectric tests. Through experiments, the minimum detectable defect sizes were determined for different curvature radius values. The results show the limitation of the power-frequency PD test and the need to use of the LI withstand test as supplementary assessment on site. Two calculable constraints of defect detectability were proposed to extend the results to GIS equipment at other voltage levels. The results clarify the cause of dielectric failure without any warning and provide technological guidance for manufacturing and installation.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.5040402},
	abstract = {SF6 is widely used in the gas-insulated metal-enclosed switchgear or the corona-stabilized gas spark switch applications as a gas dielectric. It is generally believed that the discharge characteristics are only related to the electric field distribution and gas molecular density; however, the electrode chemical reactions can indeed markedly affect the SF6 discharge characteristics in the extremely inhomogeneous electric fields under the steady-state voltage. In this study, we used a needle-plane electrode system to build an extremely inhomogeneous electric field and examined the discharge characteristics within it including U-p characteristics, corona appearance, and corona current. We also analyzed the micro-region characteristics of the electrode surface, including the surface morphology, elemental composition, and chemical state to fully qualitatively determine the role of the electrode chemical reactions in discharge behavior. We found that the N-shaped U-p curve widens, the filamentous leader channels disappear, and the corona current drops suddenly as the duration of the electrode chemical reactions increases. Varying the surface morphology, elemental composition, and chemical state was observed on the electrodes of different polarities through micro-region analysis. The metal fluoride or metal sulfide film on the electrode surface may serve as a resistive coating due to its low electrical conductivity, which obstructs the leader discharge while enhancing the streamer discharge, suppressing the transition from the streamer to leader discharge and altogether significantly altering the discharge characteristics. The resistive coating produced is the primary cause of the electrode chemical reaction effects on the discharge characteristics, primarily as it depresses the transition from the streamer to leader discharge. The results presented here may provide useful guidelines for further research on SF6 discharge under inhomogeneous electric fields. Published by AIP Publishing.},

By using a permanent-magnet synchronous motor to drive a photography mask synchronized with a discharge power supply, discharge images in a specific phase window can be recorded. Some examples of discharges photographed by this method, including the corona discharge in SF6 and the corona discharge along the air/epoxy surface, demonstrate the feasibility of this method. Therefore, this method provides an effective tool for discharge physics researchers. Published by AIP Publishing.},
