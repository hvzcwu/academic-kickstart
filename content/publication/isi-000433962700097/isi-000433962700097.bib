 abstract = {To research discharge physics under AC voltage, a phase synchronization
photography method is presented. By using a permanent-magnet synchronous
motor to drive a photography mask synchronized with a discharge power
supply, discharge images in a specific phase window can be recorded.
Some examples of discharges photographed by this method, including the
corona discharge in SF6 and the corona discharge along the air/epoxy
surface, demonstrate the feasibility of this method. Therefore, this
method provides an effective tool for discharge physics researchers.
