 abstract = {As one kind of synergistic effect gas, the discharge characteristics of
SF6/N-2 gas mixtures would be influenced significantly by trace amounts
of SF6. That is, the discharge characteristics of pure N-2 is quite
different from that of SF6/N-2 gas mixtures with relatively low content
of SF6. For the application of SF6/N-2 gas mixtures in power system
equipment, this paper studied on the discharge characteristics of
SF6/N-2 gas mixtures with low SF6 mixing ratio in extremely non-uniform
electric field under positive and negative lightning impulse. Meanwhile,
the characteristic of SF6/N-2 gas mixtures were compared with that of
pure N-2 and SF6. The experimental results indicate that the 50%
breakdown voltage increases linearly with the rise of gas pressure under
negative lightning impulse, and the rising rate of breakdown voltage
with pure N-2 is greater than SF6/N-2 gas mixtures even greater than
pure SF6 gas. At high gas pressure, the 50% breakdown voltage of pure
N-2 is higher than that of SF6/N-2 gas mixtures, that is to say, the
negative synergistic effect appeared. Under positive lightning impulse,
the influence of gas pressure on 50% breakdown voltage is weaker, but
the N-curve characteristic appeared because of the effect space charge.
Meanwhile, the negative synergistic effect also appeared under positive
lightning impulse at high gas pressure. The experimental results
indicate that the breakdown time delay of pure N-2 is much longer than
that of SF6/N-2 gas mixtures with 1% SF6 mixing ratio because of the
obvious difference between the formative time delay of N-2 and SF6/N-2
gas mixtures. The phenomenon of breakdown time delay demonstrates that
the discharge form of N-2 is different from that of SF6/N-2 gas
mixtures, that is to say, the streamer propagation changes to
streamer-leader propagation.},
