abstract: "In recent years, SF6/N-2 binary mixtures have been used as insulation in second generation gas-insulated metal-enclosed transmission lines mainly because of the greenhouse effect and diseconomy of SF6. Though the synergistic effect of SF6 is known in a uniform electric field, there is little understanding of the synergistic effect phenomenon with parameters in a non-uniform electric field under standard lightning impulse. A series of experiments were designed to increase our knowledge of this and the breakdown characteristics of SF6/N-2 under multiple parameters show a negative synergistic effect. Our experimental results with negative lightning impulse demonstrated that the breakdown voltage of N-2 increased greater than with both SF6 and its mixtures with increasing gas pressure. When the gas pressure exceeded 0.3MPa, the breakdown voltage of pure N-2 was higher than SF6/N-2 gas mixtures and even exceeded the value of SF6 at 0.5MPa. A normalization coefficient h was introduced in this research to evaluate the negative synergistic effect. Under negative lightning impulse the analytical results show that the negative synergistic effect increased with the augment of gas pressure. On the other hand, the synergistic effect was reduced with decreasing gas pressure under positive polarity impulse and it appeared to be a negative synergistic effect with the enhancement of field non-uniformity. The analysis of streamer discharge propagation indicates three reasons lead to the negative synergistic effect: similar streamer corona onset voltage, different space charge effect, and dissimilar discharge form of N-2 and SF6/N-2 gas mixtures."
