 abstract = {Corona discharge under super low frequency (30-300 Hz) voltage is common
in high-voltage transmission lines and equipment. The phase resolved
partial discharge (PRPD) pattern is the most commonly used tool for
power equipment condition-monitoring in the electrical engineering
field. The present study centers on the correspondence between PRPD
patterns and corona discharge modes under a wide range of applied
voltage. Electric and optical emission characteristic measurement
methods are applied to obtain PRPD patterns and phase resolved discharge
images. The transition of corona discharge types and space charge
behavior under different applied voltage are investigated. The electric
field generated by negative needle electrode is shown to erase residual
positive ions, which leads to an abundance of positive streamer bursts
when applied voltage is low. Once the negative glow corona emerges under
higher applied voltage, dense positive ions in the cathode sheath
suppress the positive streamer bursts. The existence of residual
positive ions is crucial for the transition from positive streamer
discharge to glow corona discharge. A comprehensive understanding of
PRPD patterns may help electrical engineers to assess the threat of
partial discharge of the power equipment correctly.},
