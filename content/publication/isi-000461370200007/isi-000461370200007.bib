 abstract = {Experiments demonstrate a strong dependence of the energy deposition and
morphology of exploding Al wires in argon gas on ambient pressures,
charging voltage, and wire sizes. The specific energy deposition, before
voltage collapse, increases with increasing ambient pressures and
applied voltage but decreases with increasing wire sizes. The
observation of the spatiotemporal distribution of exploding wires
indicates that increased energy deposition suppresses the axial
inhomogeneity, especially for large-sized wires, and improves the
expansion velocity of the metal core. The expansion velocity of the wire
core (100 mu m in diameter, 2 cm in length) varies from similar to 0.49
km/s to similar to 2.3 km/s when the specific energy deposition
increases from 1.95 eV/atom to 3.01 eV/atom. Decreased surrounding
pressures also improve the expansion velocity. Furthermore, the analysis
of photographs and emission spectrums demonstrates that the surrounding
gases promote the formation of coronal plasmas when the pressure is no
more than 50 kPa.},
