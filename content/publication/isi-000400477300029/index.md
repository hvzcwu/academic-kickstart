abstract: "Operating experience shows that residual DC voltage remains in GIS bus bar for a long time after opening of disconnectors. This DC voltage will not only cause accumulation of charges and contaminants on the insulator surface, but will also easily lead to motion of free metallic particles in SF6 gas gap, weakening the insulation ability of GIS. At the time of disconnectors reclosing, impulse voltage could be generated in the bus bar and superimpose on the pre-existing DC voltage. As a result, GIS will be under combined voltage of DC and impulse. This paper experimentally studies the insulation characteristics of GIS under combined voltage of DC and lightning impulse. It is found that, for non-contaminated insulators, when DC and LI voltage are of the same polarity, flashover voltage under combined voltage is nearly the same as the flashover voltage under LI alone. However, when they are of the opposite polarity, flashover voltage decreases with increasing DC voltage. In cases there are metallic particle or powder around insulator, pre-stressed DC voltage will cause adhesion of contaminants on the insulator surface and lead to decrease of flashover voltage. Specially, for the particle-contaminated insulator, it is found that the surface charge accumulation caused by DC voltage will have big influence on the flashover voltage, and the most critical condition is when DC and LI voltage are of the opposite polarity. In addition, the breakdown characteristics of SF6 gas gap with free metallic particle are investigated. It is found that under pre-stressed DC voltage, particle will do standing motion or bouncing motion. And breakdown voltage becomes lowest when particle is doing standing motion. The results of the experiments show that residual DC voltage in GIS could deteriorate its insulation ability and the combined voltage of DC and impulse is found to be a critical condition for GIS insulation. Moreover, the combined voltage is shown to be more sensitive to detect some insulation defects in GIS than applying impulse voltage alone, especially for free metallic particles, which are commonly found in GIS but up to now no effective detection method is proposed. Therefore combined voltage of DC and impulse could be considered to serve as a supplement of field test for GIS."
