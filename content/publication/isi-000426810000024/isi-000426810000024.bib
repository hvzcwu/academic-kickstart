 abstract = {To study the statistical meaning of the time parameter t(63%) in the
Martin empirical formula, we took Kunlun 25# transformer oil as the
liquid insulating dielectric and utilized an impulse voltage generator,
the impulse width of which could range from 50 ns to 1000 its, along
with the corresponding measuring equipment. The relationships between
the breakdown voltage, the breakdown time lag and the discharge
probabilities were acquired through experiments under impulses with
quasi-uniform field. The results show that the discharge probabilities
of different voltage levels under the fixed impulse waveform and the
breakdown time lag under the same voltage level both could be well
fitted to the three parameter Weibull distribution functions, whose
shape parameter was a constant only correlated to the electrode
geometry. Meanwhile, on the basis of the Weibull distribution functions
and corresponding impulse waveforms, we defined the effective duration
and show the statistical meaning of the time parameter t(63%).},
