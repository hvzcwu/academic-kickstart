 abstract = {The trend of development of Gas Insulated System (GIS) recently
includes: miniaturization, intelligentization and high reliability. This
needs a higher insulation performance of GIS. Free conducting particle
in GIS is a main reason that causes the degradation of GIS insulation.
Free conducting particle will bring a high risk to GIS insulation when
it approaches to the high voltage conductor or reaches the disc-type
insulator surface. Particle in radial non-uniform electrical field is
apt to move along the radial direction in GIS, and probably moves into
the high insulation risk region. According to the distribution of the
electrical field between coaxial electrode systems, the dynamic model of
spherical particle in axial non-uniform electrical field under AC
voltage is amended. The motion phenomenon of particle is explained by
solving the dynamic equations. Gravitational force, Coulomb force,
electrical gradient force and gas viscous force are considered.
Improving the applied voltage can increase the motion distance in
vertical direction. The criterion can explain the incremental quantity
of the motion onset voltage of particle in uniform field under AC
voltage than it under DC voltage. Observations indicate that voltage
exerts an incremental effect on maximum height. By analyzing improved
dynamic model of spherical particle, another novel criterion to judge
the penetration of the motion of spherical particle in uniform field
under AC voltage is brought forward, as well.},
