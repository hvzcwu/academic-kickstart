 abstract = {This study aimed to clarify the basic process of streamer propagation in
mineral oil at bipolar oscillating impulse voltage. Shadow images and
light signals of streamers showed that under bipolar oscillating
impulse, positive and negative streamers propagated in an alternating
manner: after polarity reversal, new streamers with opposite polarity
were initiated and propagated first through the gaseous channels left
behind by former streamers and then toward the ground electrode. The
velocity of positive streamers was found nearly an order of magnitude
higher than that of negative ones; thus, positive streamers are
primarily responsible for the insulation failure of mineral oil.
Negative streamers played the role of maintaining gaseous channels and
facilitating positive streamers initiation due to their strong heat
effect. High oscillation frequency and large damping factor decreased
the durations and amplitudes of positive peaks, which restrained
positive streamer propagation and further resulted in the increase in
the breakdown voltage. Experiments on dielectric behavior of mineral oil
were conducted to verify above inferences. Published by AIP Publishing.},
